# CSV Header Detection

We provide an [example implementation](experiments/csv_header_detection/detect_headers_by_lookup.ipynb) of the CSV header detection method described in the paper.

## Pollock Benchmark

We provide the code of our [schemapile-augmentation](experiments/csv_header_detection/pollock-schemapile-augmentation/pycsv.py) method that was used in the Pollock experiment.
